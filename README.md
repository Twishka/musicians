Last.fm popular artists sorting can be rather frustrating, so I created this tool that lets you find out what the real
most popular musicians are.

All you need to do is run musicians.py, and insert:
    1. The tag you want to search by.
    2. The minimum number of listeners (if you don't want to see someone only known by 10 people). Just type 0 if it
    doesn't matter.
    3. The maximum number of artists you want to see in your table. The site's maximum is 1000.
